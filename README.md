# Programming Hero - Assignment Responsive Football Website

This is a solution to the [Responsive Football Website - An assignment by Programming Hero](https://github.com/ProgrammingHero1/responsive-football).

## My process

- I added two new part, as the extra work. I added a login form and a pricing section. I keep the highlights section though.

### Built with

- Raw HTML5 (Semantic Tags) and CSS3, Flexbox and Grid

### What I learned

- Here I follow the raw figma file as much as possible. In media queries, I learn a lot and tweking some points and discover the breakpoints.
- Here I use some transition effect on the player's photo gallery. Though that was not a requirement. But that was fun, and I learn a lot.
